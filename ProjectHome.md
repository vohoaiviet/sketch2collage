Sketch-to-collage is a tool to aid you in the creation of image collages. You start the collage by drawing a rough sketch on a canvas (left), and then similar images from your collection are retrieved, matching color compositions and also individual objects. The composite is then created by combining several state-of-the-art tools for color and contour blending.
